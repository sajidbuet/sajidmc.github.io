Hello, I am Dr. Sajid Muhaimin Choudhury, working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of EEE, BUET. I completed my PhD from the School of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sajidmc) in [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/). I have the privilege of acquiring skills of both experimental and numerical approaches to solve problems related to photonics. My goal is to establish an independent research career in Bangladesh with multidisciplinary collaborations to attack problems related to food safety, energy, healthcare and communications.
