abstract: The conventional fiber communication band of 1.55 textmum is reaching its
  limit attributable to the escalation in bandwidth requirements for high-speed and
  bulk data transmission. Researchers are exploring a 2 textmum waveband for its higher
  capacity and low attenuation as a solution for the next generation communication
  technologies. Accordingly, here we report an optically engineered metasurface for
  this waveband for fiber coupling or lensing. The structure is polarization-insensitive
  and dynamically tunable between its reflective (OFF) and transmissive (ON) modes.
  For tunability, we incorporate a novel phase change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for
  its faster, non-volatile, and reversible metallic-to-insulator phase transition.
  The integration of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a micro-heater to electrically modulate
  the light by altering the phase of IST provides the device with additional functionality
  for point-of-care applications. Using the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) technique,
  we have achieved a modulation depth of 90%. The focusing efficiency is as high as
  76% and the ON-OFF switching ratio of the optimized lens is 26 dB. The multilayer
  insertion of thin IST ensures uniform phase transition with switching energy as
  low as 232.98 nJ/textmum2. Thus, with remarkable performance at 2 textmum and dynamic
  multifunctionality, our proposed device will revolutionize the upcoming telecommunication
  technologies and beyond.
