 abstract = {Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs) enable the realization of practical plasmonic and metamaterial devices at the telecommunication frequency due to their low optical loss and CMOS compatibility. By employing a conventional dry-etching process, we have fabricated GZO plasmonic waveplates, which convert linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light.},
