abstract: A metal/dielectric multilayered metasurface can be used to engineer the
  plasma frequency by controlling the ratio between the metal and dielectric layers.
  In this work, we demonstrate that a multilayered nanodisk metasurface based on semiconductor
  materials offers the design flexibility for tuning the plasmonic resonance.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
