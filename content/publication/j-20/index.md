abstract: Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective
  transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the
  material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp
  turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design
  a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological
  insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator
  design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as
  low as textminus54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary
  operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm
  and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple
  operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch
  off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage
  utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute
  to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength,
  electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.
