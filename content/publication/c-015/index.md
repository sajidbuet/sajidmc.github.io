abstract: A hybrid plasmonic waveguide fabrication technique has been developed and
  waveguides fabricated using this technique have been demonstrated experimentally.
  The developed technique can be utilized for creating similar hybrid waveguide structures
  and metasurfaces with an array of material platforms such as transition metal nitrides
  and epitaxial silver.
