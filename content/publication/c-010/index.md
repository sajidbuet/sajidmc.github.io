abstract: Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs) enable the realization of practical
  plasmonic and metamaterial devices at the telecommunication frequency due to their
  low optical loss and CMOS compatibility. By employing a conventional dry-etching
  process, we have fabricated GZO plasmonic waveplates, which convert linearly polarized
  light into circularly polarized light.
