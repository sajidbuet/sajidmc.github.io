## Announcement
We will use Microsoft Teams for disbursing class materials for the course. Please contact your respective course instructor if you have not been added to the class team "EEE 415 C (July 2023)".

## Introduction
The syllabus of this course has been changed and the course has been completely redesigned from grounds up.

## Syllabus (as approved in 2022)
Fundamentals of microprocessor and computer design, processor data path, architecture, microarchitecture, complexity, metrics, and benchmark; Instruction Set Architecture, introduction to CISC and RISC, Instruction-Level Parallelism, pipelining, pipelining hazards and data dependency, branch prediction, exceptions and limits, super-pipelined vs superscalar processing; Memory hierarchy and management, Direct Memory Access, Translation Lookaside Buffer; cache, cache policies, multi-level cache, cache performance; Multicore computing, message passing, shared memory, cache-coherence protocol, memory consistency, paging, Vector Processor, Graphics Processing Unit, IP Blocks, Single Instruction Multiple Data and SoC with microprocessors. Simple Arm/RISC-V based processor design with VerilogHDL 

Introduction to embedded systems design, software concurrency and Realtime Operating Systems, Arm Cortex M / RISC-V microcontroller architecture, registers and I/O, memory map and instruction sets, endianness and image, Assembly language programming of Arm Cortex M / RISC-V based embedded microprocessors (jump, call-return, stack, push and pop, shift, rotate, logic instructions, port operations, serial communication and interfacing), system clock, exceptions and interrupt handling, timing analysis of interrupts, general purpose digital interfacing, analog interfacing, timers: PWM, real-time clock, serial communication, SPI, I2C, UART protocols, Embedded Systems for Internet of Things (IoT)

## Grading Policy
* Class Attendance (10%) – Class participation and attendance will be recorded in every class. 30 Marks as per university AC policy

* Continuous Assessment (20%) – 
1 assignment (20) – Mandatory
3 Class tests, best 2 counted (40)

* Final Examination (70%)– A comprehensive term final examination will be held at the end of the Term following the guideline of the Academic Council

## Weekly Schedule
As per the routine published in the Department of EEE website.
