##Announcement
We will use Microsoft Teams for disbursing class materials for the course. Please contact your respective course instructor if you have not been added to the class team.

##Introduction
The syllabus of this course has been changed and the course has been completely redesigned from grounds up. There has been a lab development proposal that is under consideration with the University authority. We anticipate changing to FPGA based Microprocessor design and ARM/RISC-V Microcontroller based embedded systems design. As procurement is a time-consuming process, we might need to improvise and use existing lab infrastructure for this semester.

## Syllabus (as approved in 2022)
Fundamentals of microprocessor and computer design, processor data path, architecture, microarchitecture, complexity, metrics, and benchmark; Instruction Set Architecture, introduction to CISC and RISC, Instruction-Level Parallelism, pipelining, pipelining hazards and data dependency, branch prediction, exceptions and limits, super-pipelined vs superscalar processing; Memory hierarchy and management, Direct Memory Access, Translation Lookaside Buffer; cache, cache policies, multi-level cache, cache performance; Multicore computing, message passing, shared memory, cache-coherence protocol, memory consistency, paging, Vector Processor, Graphics Processing Unit, IP Blocks, Single Instruction Multiple Data and SoC with microprocessors. Simple Arm/RISC-V based processor design with VerilogHDL 

Introduction to embedded systems design, software concurrency and Realtime Operating Systems, Arm Cortex M / RISC-V microcontroller architecture, registers and I/O, memory map and instruction sets, endianness and image, Assembly language programming of Arm Cortex M / RISC-V based embedded microprocessors (jump, call-return, stack, push and pop, shift, rotate, logic instructions, port operations, serial communication and interfacing), system clock, exceptions and interrupt handling, timing analysis of interrupts, general purpose digital interfacing, analog interfacing, timers: PWM, real-time clock, serial communication, SPI, I2C, UART protocols, Embedded Systems for Internet of Things (IoT)
