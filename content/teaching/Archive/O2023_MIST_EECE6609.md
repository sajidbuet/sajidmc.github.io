## Welcome

Welcome to the course on EECE 6609 Nano Systems. This course is offered to the Post Graduate Students of the Dept of EECE of the Military Institute of Science and Technology, with permissiion from the BUET authorities. We are taking classes through Google Classroom and all communications for this course will be done through the class team of the course. **This webpage will not be updated, and kept just for prospective students to have an idea about the course.**  

## Class Schedule
Saturday 3pm-6pm
Room EECE 701, Tower 3, MIST

## Background

This course is a first year graduate level course for students who are interested in doing research on Nano Systems and Nano Technology and their great wonders. 

As a graduate level course, we would focus on active learning in the course, where you will participate in group project to grasp the concepts and learn about the vast field. The course will be really useful if you are thinking about pursuing research in Nanophotonics, or want to know more about the field.



## Syllabus
### Course Content
Nanosystems and Devices: Introduction- nanomaterials, nanodevices, nanostructures. Nanoscale Lithography: X-ray, Electron-Beam and Ion-Beam; Soft Lithography; Scanning Probe Lithography. Advances in Device Technology: nanoscale silicon devices, process technology, present challenges. Self Assembled Nanocrystals: self assembly, surface defects and passivation, structures, energy levels, transitions, luminescence and lasing. 
Nano Electro Mechanical Systems (NEMS): stress in thin films, mechanical to electrical transduction, surface engineering techniques, process flow, NEMS actuators, high aspect ratio
system technology. Nano Biotechnology: scope and dimensions; detection of biological species on electrical, mechanical and optical criteria; Bio functionality on silicon; Biochip
sensors and systems- structures, process technology. 

### Learning Outcomes (LO)
On successful completion of this course unit, students should be able to:
1. Understand the Nano systems and Devices.
2. Become Advances in Device Technology.
3. Analyze the Nano Electro Mechanical Systems.
4. Demonstrate the bio functionality on silicon.
### Teaching-learning Strategy
Class lectures, Case studies, Research papers review, Practical problem solution etc.

## Grading Policy

* **Final Review Papaer - 40%** 
* **Final presentaation - 10%** 
* **Final Examination - 50%** 

## Expectation
It would be expected that by the end of the course, you are able to do a comprehensive review on a particular topic of interest and are able to effectively communicate it orally. Regular participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged. Although, preparing the class presentations and report would demand time and effort, hopefully, by successful completion of the work, you would have a publishable work, and we can discuss after the end of the semester if we can compile and publish the work.

It is expected that students sign an honour pledge for the class and refrain from plagiarising. All reports would be checked with turnitin plagiarism checker and any plagiarized work would be dealt with a "F" grade in the entire course. 

# Detailed Grading Policy

## Final Project + Presentation (40%)
For Final Project, you must do an original comprehensive literature review on a particular topic relevant to the course and write a minimum 1600 word **Review Article** on it, with at least 35 literature references. 

### Scope of write up (including but not limited to):
1. Broad introduction of the field
2. Present Challenges
3. Fabrication methods
4. Breakthrough publications
5. Significant applications

### Instruction:
You need to form groups of * students. Each group will work on a particular scope. I will circulate a google form where you can give choice regarding the topics. Each group's broad topic should be unique.

Once you choose broad the topic, you need to do choose a special topic from it (as for example, from Nanophotonic systems a special topic can be imaging with metasurface). Your subtopic should be unique in a sense that there is no other review paper on the particular subtopic. Prepare a short outline of the paper (Introduction, Conclusion, which topics you will be covering etc) do a literature search on the topic and create an outline of your paper. Deadline to submit the outline is 2 weeks. 

After I okay the outline, you need to do further literature search and form your review on the topic. You are expected to write a publishable review on the topic.  Here are some resources that might help you in the process:

[Ten Simple Rules for Writing a Literature Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3715443/)

[Writing a review article](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/writing-a-review-article/)

[How To Write A Scientific Review Research Paper](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/04/06/how-to-write-a-scientific-review-research-paper/#6d6694076c1b)

To improve writing skill, I highly recommend the Kristin Sainani's course from Stanford University, [Writing in the Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite/home/welcome). Complete week 1-5 of the course to improve your writing style. 

Originality of work: The paper that you write must be an original work of your own writing. The goal of the assignment is for you to learn writing a review. The papers will be checked with plagiarism checking software. Any similarity with already published work will result in a failure (F) in the assignment. Read this article on [avoiding plagiarism](https://www.plagiarism.org/article/preventing-plagiarism-when-writing)

If you choose to do so, I am willing to work on the final paper further with the possibility of publishing it in a peer-reviewed journal. This will be done after completion of the grading of the course to avoid any bias on grades.

### Review Article LaTeX Template
The following overleaf project is exclusively made for this project. You MUST use this template to format the final submission of your project.
