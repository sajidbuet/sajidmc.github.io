#### EEE 303 - Digital Electronics

"There are 10 types of people in this world. Those who understand binary, and those who doesn't."

Welcome to the course on Digital Electronics, where we will explore the very fundamental concepts that makes most of our modern consumer electronic products function.

* Springer has a free book available to download from there website ( [click here](https://www.thebiomics.com/notes/springer-free-e-books-list.html?fbclid=IwAR1cNh08WpCObvLxeQHtRMJUqGcPSMDmnTOTTF9aXANVzEVZN7M64GrgkxI) ) called Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with Verilog by B. J. LaMeres (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-13605-5_8). We will teach some of the lectures from this book as it has very intuitive approach to a lot of the problems.
