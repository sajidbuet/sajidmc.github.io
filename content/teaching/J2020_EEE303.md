####Welcome

"There are 10 types of people in this world. Those who understand binary, and those who doesn't."

Welcome to the course on Digital Electronics, where we will explore the very fundamental concepts that makes most of our modern consumer electronic products function. 

###Schedule

##Announcement

For online trial classes, we have a Google Classroom setup for the course. Please sign up for Google Classroom at classroom.google.com and join the class there using the following code: 4vx7zvt
We will post the Zoom meeting link there for joining the class.

Springer has a free book available to download from there website ( [click here](https://www.thebiomics.com/notes/springer-free-e-books-list.html?fbclid=IwAR1cNh08WpCObvLxeQHtRMJUqGcPSMDmnTOTTF9aXANVzEVZN7M64GrgkxI) ) called Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with Verilog by B. J. LaMeres (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-13605-5_8). We will teach some of the lectures from this book as it has very intuitive approach to a lot of the problems.

####Office Hours
Tues 12-1pm (Section A)
Saturday 12-1pm (Section B) 
I will be in my office at EEE 222, and students are welcome to drop by with any questions/problems related to the class or for conceptual understanding of the topics. Other than office hours, prior appointment must be made to schedule a meeting. 
For any course related matter outside the class, preferred medium of communication is email

####Homework Problems
N.B. - Please write the following on the top of the homework:

Student ID:

Course Number: EEE 303

Course Instructor: Dr. Sajid Muhaimin Choudhury

Homework Number: 1A  Date of Submission: XX


#####Homework 1A
An alien species have landed on earth that have four hands with 9 fingers on each hand (36 fingers in total). They follow a base-36 number system. We will define variable 'X' and variable 'Y' in their number system. The first 3 letters of your first name is variable X, last 3 letters of your last name is variable Y, first letter of your last name is variable Z (For example for Mahbubur Rahman, X=MAH, Y=MAN, Z=R, X,Y,Z are in base-36) 

Problem 1: Convert X and Y to decimal, binary, hexadecimal and octal number

Problem 2: In binary and decimal, compute X+Y, X-Y. Compute 2's complement of Y in binary and recompute X-Y

Problem 3: Represent the floating point number X.Y in IEEE single precision floating point number 

Problem 4: Convert X to grey code and ASCII

Problem 5: Install Altera Quartus. Show the value of Z in Binary and hexadecimal. Attach a printed copy of the waveform with your file 

#####Homework 1B 
Problem 1: Convert Z from problem 1 into binary and take the first 8 bits from the MSB. Assume the function f(A,B,C) is defined as these first 8 bits denoted by 'G'. Write the truth table of the function, write the function in terms of Sum of Products and Product of Sum form, and draw a K-map of the function and reduce it to minimum form.

Problem 2: Write a verilog code that generates fibonacci sequence of a number. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

Fibonacci number, F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2); F_0 = 1; F_1 = 1

Input: clock
Output: 16 bit fibonacci number

each time clock changes state from 0 to 1, the fibonacci number output is changed, showing from F_0, F_1, F_2 etc. 

Case 1: F_0 = 1; F_1 = 1; (Regular fibonacci number)
Case 2: F_0 = G; and F_1 = 1; 

Show (print) output for both cases for 16 different clock changes
