#### Foreword
Letter of recommendation is a necessity to advance in your career. It brings me utmost joy to see our students succeed in life, and is always a pleasure to give recommendation letter to potential applicants for job or higher studies. 

Please remember that I can only address your accomplishments that <span style="color:red">I was actively involved in</span>. Ask yourself if I would be the right person to judge your research aptitude and skills. I will try to give an **honest** and **impartial** assessment, so also ask yourself if my recommendation would **help** or **hurt** your chances of succeeding.

### Criteria for Getting Recommendation
you <span style="color:red">MUST</span> meet at least one of the following five descriptions/criteria before you try to make an appointment with me for recommendation request.

  * You performed MSc/PhD research work under my supervision
  
  * I served as a  member in your MSc/PhD examination committee
  
  * Final year thesis/project completed under my supervision
  
  * Performed some kind of project work under my guidance
  
  * My undergraduate advisee 

If you are only an undergraduate advisee without any research/work experience with me, please note that I would only be able to verify your GPA, and mention courses that you took with me, and would not be able to strongly recommend you.

### Waiver of Access
In order to receive a LOR from me, you **must Waive the right to access** to what I write. If you do not waive your access, I would also **decline** to recommend you. I believe you should only get my recommendation if you trust my judgement sufficiently. I will, however, tell you in person, if I cannot give you a positive recommendation.

### Information Required
Please provide the following information in email when you are requesting the LOR. I would let you know in email, if I can recommend you, if I need to meet you for an interview, or if I am not in the best position to recommend you.
