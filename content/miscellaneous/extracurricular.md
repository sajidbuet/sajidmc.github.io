#### Photography
I used to be a photography enthusiast with my Nikon D5100. Now, mostly I would just use my iphone to capture photos. [Flickr <i class="fa fa-flickr"></i>](https://www.flickr.com/photos/50626594@N00). 

#### Music
I taught my self to play guitar and still trying to improve my skills. I try to tab different Bangla songs as I learn them and upload them online.

#### Website Development
I also like to hack PHP and html files for web development. I had created the new version of the [Department of EEE](http://eee.buet.ac.bd) website with Joomla. [Bangladesh Academy of Sciences](http://www.bas.org.bd/credits), [Purdue BDSA](http://www.bdsapurdue.org), [Nanotechnology Student Advisory Council](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NSAC) are some of the websites that I made. My current website is based on [PicoCMS](http://picocms.org/).

Currently, I maintain the following web projects:

My father, Late Dr. Naiyyum Choudhury's remembrance and his works are hosted here:
